## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I am a third-semester PhD student in computer science at the University of Missouri, Columbia with a passion for machine learning and software engineering.
My research interest are computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. Lately, I have been focusing on using machine learning in bioinfomatics. 
Feel free to reach out to me to talk about machine learning, software engineering, bioinformatics or anything in general!
