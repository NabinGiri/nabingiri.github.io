I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics at the University of Missouri, where I work as a graduate researcher in the Bioinformatics and Machine Learning Lab under the supervision of Dr. Jianlin Cheng. My research focuses on designing, developing, and applying deep learning methods to advance computational biology. I received the Outstanding PhD Student Award for my academic and research contributions.

During my PhD, I attended the Oxford Machine Learning Summer School (2022-2023) and completed research internships with BIOVIA and Amazon. At BIOVIA, I developed an innovative AlphaFold-based deep learning workflow for conformational sampling, featured in a <a href="https://blog.3ds.com/brands/biovia/journey-into-nabin-giris-biovia-internship-conformational-sampling-with-alphafold/" target="_blank">BIOVIA blog post</a>. At Amazon, I fine-tuned multimodal models and developed deep learning models for relevance prediction.

Before my PhD, I completed an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Central Missouri under the guidance of Dr. Yui Man Lui, where my thesis, <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/6591586" target="_blank"> Recommendation System Using Factorization Model and MapReduce Framework</a>, received the Graduate Research Award. I also received a graduate housing scholarship for academic performance. Additionally, I worked as a graduate student worker and served as an international student ambassador.

Before pursuing my MSc, I worked as a Software Engineer at Capgemini and led a team as a System Engineer at Max International. I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Bangalore University, where I developed two projects: Supermarket Management System and Online Admission System.
